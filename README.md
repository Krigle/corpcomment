This project is built using TypeScript, React, and Zustand, providing a modern and efficient development stack. Below are the key components and techniques used in the project:

Technologies Used:
• TypeScript:
TypeScript is utilized for type safety and static type checking, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

• React:
The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

•Zustand:
Zustand is employed as the state management library, offering efficient state management compared to the Context API.

• Asynchronous JavaScript:
Asynchronous JavaScript techniques such as async/await and promises are used for fetching data from external APIs.

• JSX:
JSX is used for writing UI components, providing a syntax similar to HTML within JavaScript/TypeScript files.

• Event Handling:
Event handling is implemented in React components to manage user interactions such as button clicks and form submissions.

• Component Composition:
The project utilizes component composition to break down the UI into smaller, reusable components, enhancing maintainability and readability.

• Conditional Rendering:
Techniques for conditional rendering are used to display UI elements based on specific conditions or states.

• Performance Optimization:
Performance optimization techniques such as useMemo are employed to optimize rendering performance and minimize unnecessary re-renders.

• Preventing Event Bubbling: Techniques are implemented to prevent event bubbling in the DOM, ensuring events triggered on specific elements do not propagate to their parent elements.

• Folder Structure Organization:
The project follows a well-organized folder structure to maintain a clean and scalable codebase.

• API Integration:
Integration with external APIs is implemented for fetching and posting data to and from the backend server.

• Form Validation:
Basic form validation techniques are implemented to validate user input before submitting data to the backend.

• Error Handling:
Error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users in case of failures.

• DOM Manipulation:
DOM manipulation techniques are used to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions and application state changes.
